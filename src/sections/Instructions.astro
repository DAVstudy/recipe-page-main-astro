        <li><span>Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
            You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
        <li><span>Heat the pan:</span> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
        <li><span>Cook the omelette:</span> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
            the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
        <li><span>Add fillings (optional):</span> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
            middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li><span>Fold and serve:</span> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
            fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
        <li><span>Enjoy:</span> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
